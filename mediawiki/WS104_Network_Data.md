## Background

The objective of this workstream is to provide network data which meets
the desired quality requirements of DynaMIT. In the short term this
means the provision of network data for the Singapore expressway system.
In the longer term this will mean the provision of network data for the
whole of Singapore.

  - **Shapefile conversion for MITSIM:** The key network data input for
    the DynaMIT Singapore Expressway dataset is a dataset of all of the
    Singapore road network used by another MIT software called MITSIM.
    This document explains how data is converted from a shapefile of
    Aimsun and Navteq data, into a format usable by MITSIM.
