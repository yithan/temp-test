## FM GIT server (Obsolete)

DynaMIT code was initially maintained in SMART-FM's internal git server,
details as below. It is not active now and is obsolete.

You need:

  - (1) Linux OS (I am not sure whether VirtualBox works)
  - (2) Create a folder for DynaMIT.

<!-- end list -->

  - step 1: Start a Terminal, go to the folder you created
  - step 2: Run the following command: git clone
    <ssh://USERNAME@137.132.22.82:15011/home/git/repositories/dynamit>

You should have an account in the Server. If you cannot access, then
please contact the DynaMIT system admininstrator

You should be able to find a folder named "dynamit"

## Github

The latest DynaMIT codebase has been migrated to github, under
"smart-fm" orgnisation.

Run below command to obtain the source code:

    git clone https://github.com/smart-fm/dynamit.git REPO_NAME

You need to enter the Github account with the password as it prompts.
You account must also have read permission to DynaMIT project under
smart-fm organisation.
