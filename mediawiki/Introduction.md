## Overview

**DynaMIT-R** (Dynamic Network Assignment for the Management of
Information to Travelers) is a real time dynamic traffic assignment
system that provides traffic predictions and travel guidance. DynaMIT
generates prediction-based guidance with respect to departure time,
pre-trip path and mode choice decisions and en-route path choice
decisions. It supports both prescriptive and descriptive information. In
order to guarantee the credibility of the information system, the
guidance provided by DynaMIT is consistent, meaning that it corresponds
to traffic conditions that most likely will be experienced by drivers.
Hence, DynaMIT provides user-optimal guidance, which implies that users
cannot find a path that they would prefer compared to the one they chose
based on the provided information.

## Structure of the Wiki

This Wiki has been developed for all people working on the project. It
acts as a repository of all the important knowledge, documents, and data
for the project. As this site is passwork protected most useful files

non-confidentiality agreements. Any data which requires such an
agreement to be signed will NOT be found on this wiki.

The Wiki is divided into various sections:

  - **Documentation:** This section contains links to all published
    papers and presentations concerning DynaMIT and DynaMIT 2.0. It
    should be noted that unpublished papers about certain aspects of
    DynaMIT are likely to be found in other parts of the Wiki -
    particulary in the section 'DynaMIT 2-0'.

  - **Training:** This contains a beginners guide to running DynaMIT as
    well as someother useful information on running and calibrating
    DynaMIT.
