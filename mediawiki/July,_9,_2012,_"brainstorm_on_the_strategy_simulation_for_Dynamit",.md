  - Time: July, 9, 2012
  - Topic: Brainstorm on the strategy simulation for Dynamit
  - Venue: DR9, COM2 04-06

Memo:

  - Gary proposed one suggestion scenario:
    1.  Build a virtual traffic system, using MitsimLab or SimMobility
        (suggested by Seth);
    2.  Connect DynaMIT with MitSimLab or SimMobility;
    3.  Build Stratey Generation in DynaMIT (focus on Expressway
        firstly)
    4.  Feedback Guidance to MitSimLab;
    5.  Evaluate effects of Strategy Generation
    6.  If we can show it in next Workshop, that will be good.
  - Seth is working (leading) on DynaMIT & SimMobility GUI Project. So,
    It is very interesting to think about how is the GUI of startegy
    generation look like.
  - Gary explains the flowchart of Strategy Generation, One key word is
    "Historical Record".
  - Xu Yan explains what is DynaMIT-R & DynaMIT-P. The keyword is
    real-time data inputs and real-time feedback.
  - Xu Yan explains what DynaMIT-R GUI should look like.
  - Seth is still working on his PhD thesis, it will be helpful for us
    to read it.
  - Jenny is interested with Control Strategy Modeling, which is very
    hard to do.
  - Xu Yan should give a presenttaion to explain DynaMIT & Strategy
    Generation.
