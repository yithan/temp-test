You can find the DynaMIT demo package in DynaMIT's
[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/z8aqxn09lqch4kt/AABgjX2jT78XUcqZRwGJUXUea?dl=0).

This package contains the DynaMIT 2.0 core functionalities with florian
network. However, the scenario analyzer and strategy simulation
components are not included in the package (they're external to DynaMIT
core). If you need them, please find them below:

  - Scenario analyzer component, to be extracted and placed *inside*
    DynaMIT working directory: available in DynaMIT's
    [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3rxffmero7kbn9l/scenario_analyser.tar.gz?dl=0).
  - Strategy Simulation component, to be extracted and placed *parallel*
    to DynaMIT working directory: [package to be updated by
    Samarth/Shi](package_to_be_updated_by_Samarth/Shi "wikilink").

For detailed instructions on setting up and configure each component,
please refer to [scenario analyser
page](DynaMIT_2.0_Scenario_Analyzer "wikilink") and [strategy simulation
page](DynaMIT_2.0_Strategy_Simulation "wikilink").

In addition, the demo package is not configured with closed loop mode.
If you need to run DynaMIT in closed loop with MitSIM, please refer to
[Closed loop framework](MITSIM#Close_Loop_Framework "wikilink"). The
