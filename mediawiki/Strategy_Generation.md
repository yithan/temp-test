## Introduction

## DynaMIT-R with Strategy Generation

**DynaMIT-R**

DynaMIT-R is designed for to use:

  - Historical OD Matrix
  - Real-Time Traffic Data Feed (count, flow \[optional\], incident,
    traffic control \[signal\])
  - Off-line & On-line Calibration
  - OD estimation/prediction model
  - A Mesoscopic Simulator

to DO:

  - Short-term traffic prediction (speed, flow & density)

**Strategy Generation**

Strategy Generation is targeted to use:

  - Candidate Control Strategies
  - Short-Term Prediction
  - Distributed Symbiotic Simulation

to DO:

  - Diverge Drivers When a [congestion](congestion "wikilink") is
    predicted to happen.
  - Recover traffic conditions when an [accident](accident "wikilink")
    happened.

## Task Table

  - Performance of DynaMIT-R (MPI)
    1.  DynaMIT-R MPI Performance Report (Done) \[xuyan will give a
        presentation on next Tuesday\] (The result is bad and we should
        wait for Lulu's final results)
    2.  DynaMIT-R Multi-thread Version (it depends on whether we need
        more power on one simulation)
  - Strategy Generation
    1.  Plan Table (TBD)
    2.  Framework (version 1 Done) (version 2 On-Going)
  - GUI

## Open Questions

1.  What is our Target for next Workshop in Jan, 2013?
2.  What do we use to combine with DynaMIT, MitSimLab or Simmobility?
      - \[xuyan\]SimMobility is still not ready to use, so I prefer
        MitSim. I talked with Seth and he already used MitSim before.
        And Seth shared with me the README. I will test later to combine
        MitSim & DynaMIT, so that we can build our platform for Strategy
        Generation.
      - \[xuyan\]MITSimLab has been compiled on my PC, using Seth's
        README, it is not difficult. But the problem is that how to
        calibrate MITSimLab? I will talk with Lulu and update the Wiki
        soon.
