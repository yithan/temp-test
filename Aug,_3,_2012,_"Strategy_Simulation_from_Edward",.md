  - Topic: Presentation "Strategy Simulation" from Edward
  - Venue: DR7, COM2-3-14

-----

Memo:

  - Edward give a presentation on "Strategy Simulation", the slide is
    available in "resources"
  - Seth mentioned "Design GUI for strategy simulation", but now we do
    not know what the GUI should look like (\!\!\!).
  - Gary give an example: "Diverge Drivers from one Expressway to other
    Expressways".
  - Xuyan mentioned that there is not enough data outside of Expressway,
    and there is not a Singapore road network which is calibrated.
  - Seth & Gary mentioned about the "replication and reliability".
    DynaMIT-R's prediction is also "Random", should predict for many
    times, and then can get a reliable result. BUT, DynaMIT-R prediction
    is designed to run only one time and then feedback.
  - Edward talked about to isolate "Strategy Simulation" from the
    framework of DynaMIT-R 2.0.
  - Seth talked about "Rule-based Decision System", \[*xuyan: I cannot
    remember the content, Seth: can you explain if you read*.\]
  - Jenny mentioned variable speed limit on Expressway. (Need to check)
