This is the Singapore expressway network with some additional arterial
roads. It gives general drivers more route choices than the simple
expressway network. We've added below arterial roads to the expressway
network:

  - Bukit Timah/Dunearn road connecting CTE and PIE
  - Clementi Road connecting PIE and AYE
  - Eunos link / Still Road connecting ECP, PIE and KPE
