This page presents some useful tookits for DynaMIT project, some of
which have been developed in the DynaMIT 1.0 phase and were enriched
during the 2.0 project. Some tools are useful for the the preparation of
DynaMIT input files, and others are for visualisation or debugging
purposes, such as SensorGUI or PrintPathTopo.

## SensorGUI

Features:

  - visualise network and sensor location from "network.dat"
  - check topology by clicking on a node to highlight the links
    connected by it
  - visualise demand from "demand.dat" (whose average value greater than
    a threshold)
  - visualise incidents from incident csv file (format based on LTA
    incident database)
